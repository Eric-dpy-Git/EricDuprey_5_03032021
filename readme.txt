Welcome on my fifth project !

In this project you'll find a commercial website with dynamic product display from API and an optional selection before add to cart with local storage.

Then a form input with Regex and an order confirmation page with id number from server.

You need to clone repository and run node server from back-end to see me working...

Thanks...
